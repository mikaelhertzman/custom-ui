# Lovelace swipe card

A Lovelace card that uses [swiper](http://idangero.us/swiper/) to create a touch slider that lets you flick through multiple cards.
You can use (almost?) all options of swiper, these can be found [here](https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api).

## Installation:

You have 2 options, hosted or self hosted (manual). The first option needs internet and will update itself.

```

# Manual:

Add the following to resources in your lovelace config:
